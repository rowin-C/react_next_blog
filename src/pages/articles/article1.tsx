          In today's digital world, cybersecurity is more important than ever.
          With the amount of personal and sensitive data stored online, it's
          crucial to understand the potential threats and risks associated with
          using the internet. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the most
          common cybersecurity threats and offer tips for avoiding them.
        </p>

        <h2 className={style.h2}>Threats</h2>
        <p className={style.p}>
          One of the most common cybersecurity threats is phishing. Phishing is
          a type of social engineering attack in which attackers attempt to
          trick users into providing sensitive information, such as login
          credentials or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks can come in many
          forms, including emails, text messages, or even phone calls. To avoid
          falling victim to a phishing attack, it's important to be vigilant
          when receiving messages from unknown sources. Always verify the
          sender's identity and never click on links or download attachments
          from suspicious messages.
        </p>
        <p className={style.p}>
          Another common cybersecurity threat is malware. Malware refers to any
          type of malicious software that is designed to harm a computer or
          steal data. Malware can be spread through email attachments,
          downloads, or even ads on websites. To avoid malware infections, it's
          important to keep your computer's software up to date and to avoid
          downloading software or files from untrusted sources. Installing and
          maintaining a reputable antivirus software can also help protect your
          computer from malware.
        </p>
        <p className={style.p}>
          Social engineering attacks are another type of cybersecurity threat
          that relies on human interactions rather than software
          vulnerabilities. These attacks can take many forms, from simple
          phishing emails to more complex scams that rely on trust and
          deception. To avoid falling victim to social engineering attacks, it's
          important to be aware of the tactics that attackers use and to never
          provide sensitive information to anyone unless you can verify their
          identity.
        </p>
        <p className={style.p}>
          Finally, ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common in
          today's digital world. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a
          user's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the
          decryption key. To avoid ransomware attacks, it's important to keep
          backups of your important data and to never pay the ransom demanded by
          attackers. Paying the ransom only encourages further attacks and does
          not guarantee that your data will be restored.
        </p>
        <h2 className={style.h2}>Conclusion</h2>
        <p className={style.p}>
          In conclusion, cybersecurity threats are a serious concern in today's
          digital world. By understanding the types of threats that exist and
          taking proactive measures to protect yourself, you can minimize the
          risk of falling victim to a cybersecurity attack. Remember to stay
          vigilant, keep your software up to date, and never provide sensitive
          information unless you can verify the identity of the recipient.
